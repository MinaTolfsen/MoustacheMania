# Rapport â€“ oblig 1  
Group 2

### Team - A0
- Team name: Git Rekt
- Project name: Moustache Mania
- Team roles: Tobias With Thorsen will be team lead and Mina Tolfsen will be graphics designer and developer, and Emil Johannessen will be developer.
Since this is a small project (compared to real life), we will refrain from having many more roles, such as customer service etc. If needed, team lead will devide the necessary roles.  
Tobias is chosen as team lead because he takes responsibility and is structured. Mina is chosen as graphics designer because of her interest and hence better work enjoyment and product.
Emil is developer because of his enjoyment for IT and interest in video games.  
Mina and Tobias will of course also work as developers.  
We have all had similar courses throughout our bachelors degree. Mina made her own project in one of the mandatory assignments from INF101 and will share her knowledge on that.
